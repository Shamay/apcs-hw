Heap->binary tree with 2 properties:
-> as full as possible left to right
-> given any node n, its value v is greated than the value
	of either of its children (maxheap)

-> finding the max is the easiest function ( O(1) )
-> removeMax: remove root, replace root with the lowest, rightest, element, and pushdown
-> add: add element as lowest rightest leaf, sift up

heapsort
-> build a heap (nlogn), number the elements row by row, left to right
-> the children are numbered 2n and 2n+1, parent are n/2 (in an array)
-> sort it by taking out the max agian and again

-> adding:
-> finding median:
-> removing median:

Hash Table: Typically an array based data structure where you use a hash function to convert the key to a copy index.

Hash Function: Funtion that maps a key value onto another value as a database index (ex: h(x) = x % 100000)

Clash/Collision: when two kets hash to the same index
SOlutions: rehashing(Secondary function), linear probing(find an empty space)

Closed Hashing -> all in the table
insert -> worst case O(n)
	  best case O(n)
	   expected run time O(1)
	-> the table is sparse, h(x) disperses data uniformly
	-> Traversal O(n)

Open Hashing -> each slot in the table refers to a linked list of items that hash to that slot

Lookup:
1. TreeMap, TreeSet, HashMap, Hashset
2. Hashmap vs Treemap speeds
3. Does Java have a built-in heap? PriorityQueue
4. Implement running median

Processing is a program that quickly sets up GUI and annoting hassles in java.

Constructor:
void setup(){

}

void draw(){

}
